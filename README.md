**1. Application Architecture**

**Frontend:** React.js or Angular for a user-friendly interface.

**Backend:**  Express.js (Node.js) for API development.

**Database:** MongoDB

**Authentication:** JWT or OAuth for secure access.
**Deployment:** Docker for containerization, AWS or Azure for cloud hosting.

**2. Core Modules**

**A. Production Management**

Daily Production Tracking

Record daily egg production.
Track production rate over time (weekly/monthly).
Damage Tracking

Log damaged eggs per day.
Calculate the percentage of damaged eggs out of total production.
Feed Management

Input costs for LC (Layer Concentrate), maize, param, DORB (De-Oiled Rice Bran), medicines, and electricity.
Track feed consumption and associate it with egg production.

**B. Sales Management**

Sales Tracking

Record daily sales (quantity, price per egg, total sales amount).
Generate sales reports (daily, weekly, monthly).
Cost Calculation

Calculate the cost per egg based on total production costs (feed, salaries, transport, etc.).
Add customizable profit margins.

**C. Expense Management**

Feed Cost Tracking

Input and track feed expenses (LC, maize, param, DORB, medicines, electricity).
Calculate total feed cost per day/week/month.
Salary Management

Log salaries for employees.
Track salary payments.
Transport and Tender Costs

Input transport costs (fuel, maintenance).
Track costs for participating in tenders (if applicable).
Labour Charges

Track labor expenses related to egg collection, cleaning, packaging, etc.

**D. Profit and Financial Analysis**

Cost and Margin Analysis

Calculate the total cost per egg by factoring in all expenses.
Apply profit margin to determine selling price.
Profit Calculation

Generate weekly and monthly profit reports.
Display profit trends over time.

**E. Reporting and Analytics**

Production Reports

Generate reports showing daily, weekly, and monthly production figures.
Visualize production trends.
Sales Reports

Generate daily, weekly, and monthly sales reports.
Analyze sales performance.
Expense Reports

Show breakdown of expenses (feed, salaries, transport, etc.).
Profit Reports

Weekly and monthly profit calculations.
Visualize profit trends using graphs and charts.

**F. User Management and Roles**

Admin and User Roles
Admins can manage all aspects of the system.
Users have restricted access, e.g., only sales entry or production tracking.

**G. Notifications and Alerts**

Automated Alerts
Send alerts if feed levels are low or production drops below a threshold.
Notify users of payment due dates (salaries, suppliers, etc.).
H. Data Backup and Security
Data Backup
Automated daily/weekly data backup.
Security
Secure data with encryption and access control.

**3. Database Schema (Simplified)**

Production Table: id, date, total_eggs, damaged_eggs
Sales Table: id, date, quantity_sold, price_per_egg, total_sales
Feed Cost Table: id, date, lc_cost, maize_cost, param_cost, dorb_cost, medicine_cost, electricity_cost
Expenses Table: id, date, salaries, transport, labour_charges, tender_cost
Profit Table: id, date, total_revenue, total_expenses, profit

**4. User Interface (UI) Design**

Dashboard: Summary of daily production, sales, expenses, and profit.
Production Entry Form: Input daily production and damages.
Sales Entry Form: Log daily sales.
Expense Entry Form: Log feed, salary, transport, and other costs.
Reports Section: Generate and download reports (PDF/Excel).

**5. Technologies to Use**

Frontend: React.js with Material-UI for design.
Backend:  Node.js with Express.
Database: PostgreSQL for scalability and performance.
APIs: RESTful API for communication between frontend and backend.
Deployment: Docker, AWS EC2, or DigitalOcean for hosting.

**6. Scalability and Future Enhancements**

**Automated Inventory Management:** Track and order feed automatically.
**Integration with Accounting Software: **Sync financial data with accounting tools.
**Mobile App Version:** For on-the-go access to production and sales data.
This design provides a solid foundation for managing egg production, sales, and associated costs while keeping the system flexible and scalable for future needs.
